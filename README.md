## Challenges Faced:

### tsparticles

- **Challenge:** Integrating tsparticles library with React components was initially challenging due to differences in syntax with component max width and number of snow views.
- **Solution:** Extensive research and experimentation led to the discovery of option object properties and their usage for integrating tsparticles in our component.

### animate.css

- **Challenge:** Implementing animate.css animations seamlessly within React components posed challenges, particularly regarding timing and triggering animations.
- **Solution:** Customizing animate.css animations using React lifecycle methods and state management techniques helped overcome timing issues and ensure smooth animation transitions.

### aos

- **Challenge:** Configuring and implementing aos animations in React components was challenging, especially when dealing with scroll animations.
- **Solution:** Extensive research and experimentation led to the discovery of options for configuring and integrating aos animations in React components.

### firebase

- **Challenge:** Integrating Firebase Authentication system into React application presented challenges related to setting up authentication flows, handling user sessions, and managing authentication state.
- **Solution:** Following Firebase documentation, utilizing React Context API for state management, and leveraging asynchronous JavaScript techniques facilitated smooth integration and robust authentication functionality.

### react-helmet

- **Challenge**: Configuring React Helmet to manage the document head in a dynamic and efficient manner proved challenging, especially when dealing with multiple components and routes.
- **Solution**: Overcame the challenge by abstracting common head elements into reusable components and using React Helmet's API to dynamically update meta tags and titles based on the page content.

### react-hook-form

- **Challenge**: Learning and implementing the react-hook-form library for form management required understanding its hook-based API and integrating it seamlessly with existing form components.
- **Solution**: Addressed the challenge by following the library's documentation, experimenting with different hook options, and refactoring existing form logic to leverage react-hook-form's features effectively.

### react-router-dom

- **Challenge**: Configuring React Router for navigation and routing in a complex application structure posed challenges in managing nested routes and passing data between components.
- **Solution**: Solved the challenge by structuring the application's routes logically, utilizing route parameters and query strings for dynamic routing, and leveraging React Router's hooks for programmatic navigation.

### react-toastify

- **Challenge**: Integrating react-toastify for displaying notifications required understanding its API and customization options to ensure consistency with the project's design language.
- **Solution**: Overcame the challenge by reading the react-toastify documentation, customizing notification styles, and handling toast messages dynamically based on user actions and events.

### prop-types

- **Challenge:** Implementing prop type validation for React components posed challenges in ensuring correct data types and required props were passed, especially in larger component hierarchies.
- **Solution:** Regularly reviewing prop types, utilizing PropTypes library documentation, and incorporating PropTypes into component development workflow helped identify and resolve issues early in the development process.
